## A Quote That Defines the Film

> “All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.” – [Roy Batty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Batty)

This iconic line captures the film’s exploration of memory, mortality, and the fleeting nature of existence.

## A Sci-Fi Noir for the Ages

*Blade Runner* is more than just a sci-fi film; it’s a meditation on what it means to be human. Ridley Scott’s direction transforms Philip K. Dick’s *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?* into a visual and philosophical odyssey. The sprawling cityscapes, perpetual rain, and neon lights create a future that feels at once alien and eerily plausible.

The heart of the story lies in its characters. [Deckard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Deckard) is not the typical hero, but a reluctant figure grappling with the ethics of his actions. [Roy Batty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Batty), the supposed antagonist, delivers the film’s emotional core, culminating in his poignant final monologue.

The ambiguity surrounding Deckard’s identity as a human or replicant adds a layer of intrigue that keeps audiences debating decades later. This unresolved question epitomizes the film’s refusal to offer easy answers, inviting viewers to engage deeply with its themes.
