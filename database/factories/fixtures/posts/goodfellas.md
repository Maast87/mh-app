## A Quote That Defines the Film

> “As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.” – [Henry Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hill)

## A Deep Dive Into the Underworld

Scorsese’s *Goodfellas* is more than a mob movie—it’s an exploration of human ambition, loyalty, and the corrupting influence of power. Through the eyes of [Henry Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hill), audiences are drawn into the exhilarating highs and devastating lows of life in organized crime.

The film’s characters are as memorable as they are flawed. [Tommy DeVito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_DeSimone)’s unpredictable rage and [Jimmy Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Burke)’s cold pragmatism paint a vivid picture of the mafia’s brutal reality. Lorraine Bracco’s portrayal of Karen Hill provides a crucial perspective on the personal cost of this lifestyle.

Scorsese’s direction is a tour de force. The infamous long take tracking Henry and Karen into the Copacabana is a testament to his mastery of the craft. Paired with a soundtrack featuring classics like “Layla” and “Gimme Shelter,” the film captures the chaotic energy of its time and setting.
